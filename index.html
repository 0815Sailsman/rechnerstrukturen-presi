						<h3>Hardware Mapping</h3>
						<p>
						The important point for us is, that specific areas in memory have designated meaning.<br>
							As an example, the data stored behind address 0x12345678 might always be used by the
							processor to determine the brightness of the built in LED.<br>
							So, writing values to it has a direct effect on the system.<br>
							That is how you get stuff done on this level:<br>
							By writing the correct value to the correct place!
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2><em>OUR</em> assembly workflow</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Break the task down to a pseudocode like level</li>
							<li>Find out where in memory the current action takes place (datasheet)</li>
							<li>Check what data you need to change in what way (datasheet)</li>
							<li>Actually code it. Load the data, change it and store it again(arm thumb docs)</li>
						</ol>
						<aside style="margin-top:50px">
							Only step 4 is actually writing code. The rest is digging through datasheets and documentation.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Genereal Purpose Registers</h2>
						<aside>How to actually work with data</aside>
						<p>
						You have a few registers where you can freely do stuff (mostly r0 ... r7)<br>
						They have 32 bits of data each available<br>
						Working with specific commands on them might set flags. These are internally stored in the program state register automatically.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section style="font-size:30px">
						<h1>Sample code</h1>
						LDR r0 =<i>some .equ constant</i>	Loads the stored constant into r0<br>
						LDR r1, [r0] 				Interprets r0 as an address and loads the data behind it into r1<br>
						MOV r3, #<i>some small, I think 16 bit, .equ constant</i> 	I think same as r1 but for smaller values...<br>
						ORR r1, r1, r3			Logical or between r1 and r3 and store into r1
						STR r1, [r0]			Store the content of r1 to the adress that is stored in r0<br><br>
						<h3>ALL OF THIS CAN BE FOUND ON THE CHEATSHEET AND IN THE DOCS - BUT BETTER</h3>
					</section>

						<h2>Manuals and documentation</h2>
						As you might have noticed by now, all datasheets and documentation is provided to us in the moodle task.<br>
						For the sake of completeness, here they are again though:<br>

						<h1>Approaching the task</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Get the led working by itself</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Onboard LED is connected to GPIO Pins so check out how to set them up properly (Datasheet, mostly chapter 10)</li>
							<li>Check the board datasheet to see what pin they are connected to exactly</li>
							<li>Try to just turn on the LED in a specific color</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Try to get the button to work</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The button is also hooked up the GPIO Pins but needs some extra work compared to the LED. Set it up.</li>
							<li>The datasheet specifies where in memory you can see if a button is pressed or not. Find out where.</li>
							<li>With everything setup, try to turn on the LED only when the button is pressed</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Build a timer</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Try to build a 500ms timer. You can just count up in some register every cycle and approximate when 500ms are reached.</li>
							<li>Then, do something observable, like toggle the LED-Color when the counter is reached and reset it</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Organize into branches with subroutines</h2>
						<ul>

							<li>Now, instead of just switching the LED, you can try to branch of into a subroutine to make your code more readable.</li>
							<li>Idead would be to make subroutines for the timer, the action when it is reached, the resetting of it and much more...</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section style="font-size:30px">
						<h2>Adding shifting</h2>
						<aside>You should now be able to read the button press, use LEDs and all that organized</aside>
						The shifting part is relatively easy compared to the previous stuff, as there are direct Instructions for that.<br>
						Try to code it so, that when your timer reaches its count, you also shift left in r7.<br>
						But when the button is pressed, you instead branch of before and shift to the right.<br>
						You could also directly add the matching LED colors. Just remember to turn off the unneeded one aswell!
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>But theres more!</h2>
						<aside>You need to handle the shifting outside of the register</aside>
						<p>
						Just check after every shift if there has be an "overflow" / "underflow".<br>
						Ideally you have 2 separare branches, one for right shift one for left.<br>
						So you check in each for the outside shift and can react accordingly!
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Thats it</h2>
						If everything went according to plan you should be done now! :)
